	    <h4>Welcome to the Computational Hydrology Group</h>
            <p> This website contains an integrated collection of tools to support future water resources planning and management. This includes elements in the purple boxes above, packaged as open-source software, freely available datasets, and guidance on appropriate use.  Collectively these tools provide a foundation for understanding and adapting to future change.  This website is dedicated to explaining each of the tools and how they fit together, documenting for both the science and applications communities what resources are currently available and what major activities are currently underway.</p>
