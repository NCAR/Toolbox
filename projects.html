            <h4>Facing future challenges</h4>
            <p>Climate and hydrologic applications for water resources planning and management—such as climate impact assessments and streamflow forecasting—commonly neglect important sources of uncertainty, especially those associated with internal climate system variability, downscaling methods, and hydrologic modeling.  Too often resources are limited and tools are unavailable to evaluate more than a single source of uncertainty (e.g., using multiple global climate models).  As a result, evaluations of future risk may be over-confident.</p>
